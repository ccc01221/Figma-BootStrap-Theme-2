            <li>our privacy policy located on our website (“Privacy Policy”), and</li>

        <p>
          which are all expressly incorporated herein and must also be observed
          and followed (clauses (1) through (3) collectively, the “Agreement”).
        </p>
        <h4>
          INTRODUCTION:
        </h4>
        <p>
            All Services (including without limitation, content, such as pricing
            data) are provided “as is” and for information only. We do not buy or
            sell coins or collectible items and any posted prices are not offers to
            purchase or sell. Our prices are not a substitute for professional
            appraisals and are not guarantees of value that can be obtained for any
            particular item. You may use the Services for informational purposes
            only, and you are strongly encouraged to use multiple sources, and to
            not use our Services as the sole basis for making any decisions (such
            as, without limitation, purchase, sale, investment or pricing
            decisions); you must conduct proper due diligence and use your own
            judgment when making any such decisions. We do not guarantee the accuracy of any content, such as pricing
            data, and we are not responsible for typographical or database errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein or otherwise mutually
            agreed in writing, your use of any and all Services (including without
            limitation subscription services and/or copies, downloads, PDFs,
            screenshots, extracts, or other replications or summaries thereof) is
            for your internal use only by one end user, and may not be resold,
            shared, redistributed, published, posted publicly, or remarketed in any
            way, or used in any way to circumvent the general principle of one
            subscription per one user. Small businesses in one location may share a subscription internally
            among a small group (e.g., not more than 5 or such other number as
            determined and disclosed by us) of then-current employees in that
            location, but large companies, or companies with multiple locations,
            and/or many end users, will be required to obtain multiple
            subscriptions. We reserve the right to charge additional fees for
            additional users or “seats”. Collecting, gathering or copying content
            from our Services, in whole or in part, is strictly prohibited, whether
            manually or via automated tools such as scraping, spiders, bots, etc.
            Your violation of this paragraph (or any provision in this Agreement)
            will allow us to immediately terminate and revoke your access and
            rights in and to any Services, including without limitation canceling
            any of your paid subscriptions without refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, if and to the limited extent
          certain portions of the Services are clearly, prominently and expressly
          marked as permissible to share publicly, i.e., certain of our APIs or
          Widgets designed for the purpose of allowing you to publish selected
          portions of our data on your website via a preapproved and standardized
          widget or API feed, you are allowed to republish such standardized widget
          or API feed on your own website so long as you do not alter it or use it in
          any way other than as intended, and do not attempt to or actually change,
          alter or obscure it or any portion thereof or any content therein,
          including without limitation any branding, attribution, proprietary marks,
          or hyperlinks therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          We grant to you a limited, revocable, and nonexclusive right to create a
          hyperlink to our publicly available website(s) and/or other free (non-paid)
          publicly available portions of our Services, subject to the terms hereof,
          provided that the link does not portray us or our products or services in a
          negative, false, misleading, derogatory, or offensive matter, and provided
          you do not i-frame them or alter the content therein or in any way imply a
          relationship therewith, nor use it in any way other than as intended. You
          may not use any logo, trademark, or tradename that may be displayed in our
          Services or other proprietary content or graphic image in the link without
          our prior written consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you elect to voluntarily provide us, directly or indirectly, any data or
          information (such as, without limitation, any historical or current:
          pricing data, transaction data and/or auction data, business information,
          listings, directory information, etc.) (collectively, “Historical Data
          &amp; Listings”), you agree that we own our copy of such Historical Data
          &amp; Listings, and/or have a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive,
          royalty free license to use, publish and distribute such Historical Data
          &amp; Listings, during and after the Term. For example, and without
          limitation, if you are an auction house and you supply us with a data feed
          of auction transactions and prices, whether or not in exchange for
          publicity such as name attribution, logos, and/or links to your website,
          for us to publish on our Services, in whole or in part, then, even after
          the end of the relationship, in perpetuity, we reserve the right (in our
          discretion, but not the obligation) to continue to publish such data, in
          whole or in part, in our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          We elect in our sole discretion whether, how, when, and how frequently to
          update the data and information within our Services.

          under your account, including all applicable taxes, fees, and surcharges.

          content in our Services infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a
          notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by
          providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing
          (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on
            behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
          </li>
          <li>
            Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed,
            or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered
            by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that
            site;
          </li>
          <li>
            Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to
            be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or
            access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient
            to permit the service provider to locate the material;
          </li>
          <li>
            Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to
            contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available,
            an electronic mail;
          </li>
          <li>
            A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material
            in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner,
            its agent, or the law; and
          </li>
          <li>
            A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and
            under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of
            the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Company's designated method to receive notifications of claimed
        infringement is by emailing the Copyright Agent at    
        <a href="mailto:support@greysheet.com">support@greysheet.com</a>. You acknowledge
          that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section
          your DMCA notice may not be valid.

        <p>
          B. If you believe that your content that was removed (or to which access
          was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from
          the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law,
          to post and use the material in your content, you may send a counter-notice
          containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your physical or electronic signature;
          </li>
          <li>
            Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access
            has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before
            it was removed or disabled;
          </li>
          <li>
            A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was
            removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of
            the content; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement
            that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in Virginia,
            and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person
            who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Company may send a
          copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that
          person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10
          business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court
          order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may
          be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 or more business days after
          receipt of the counter-notice, at Company's sole discretion.

            THIS SECTION CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION
            WAIVER. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH
            US.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Except if you opt-out as expressly permitted below, or except to the extent
          contrary to applicable law ("Excluded Disputes"), you hereby agree that all
          disputes between you and us (whether or not such dispute involves a third
          party) with regard to your relationship with us, including without
          limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service,
          and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, may, in our discretion, be
          resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration
          Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you
          hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your
          claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims
          court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. You agree that
          you shall not participate in any class action or class-wide arbitration for
          any claims covered by this Agreement. You also agree not to participate in
          claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or
          consolidated claims involving another person's account, if we are a party
          to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by
          the US Federal Arbitration Act, to the extent permissible. In the event the
          American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing
          date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then
          either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by
          the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award
          rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent
          jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the
          arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards
          that conflict with these Terms of Use. You may opt out of this agreement to
          arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor we can require the other to
          participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in
          writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this
          arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:

          XVI. MISCELLANEOUS.
        </h4>
        <p>
          You shall comply with all laws, rules and regulations now or hereafter
          promulgated by any government authority or agency that are applicable to
          your use of the Services, or the transactions contemplated in this
          Agreement. You may not assign your rights or obligations hereunder, and any
          attempt by you to sublicense, assign or transfer any of the rights, duties
          or obligations hereunder or to exceed the scope of this Agreement is void.
          In the event that Company is sold to a third party, such a sale will not be
          deemed a transfer of personal information so long as that third party
          agrees to assume Company's obligations as to these Terms of Services and
          any associated Privacy Policy. This Agreement, the Services, and the rights
          and obligations of the parties with respect to the Services will be subject
          to and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Virginia,
          excluding conflict of law principles. By accessing or using any Services
          you agree that the statutes and laws of the State of Virginia, without
          regard to conflicts of law principles thereof, will apply to all matters
          arising from or relating to the use thereof. You also agree and hereby
          submit to the exclusive legal jurisdiction and venues of the Courts of
          Virginia Beach with respect to such matters. This is the entire agreement
          between you and Company with regard to the matters described herein and
          govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between
          you and Company with respect thereto. The failure of Company to exercise or
          enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a
          waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is
          found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
          nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the
          parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions
          hereof shall remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of
          any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising
          out of this Agreement or related to use of the Services must be filed
          within three (3) months after such claim or cause of action arose or be
          forever barred.
